# Snake-Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game in Python using the turtle module. In this game, the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food pellets and growing in length with each pellet eaten. The game ends if the snake hits the wall or collides with its own body.

## Installation
To run the game, you will need Python 3 installed on your machine. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

After installing Python, you will also need to install the turtle module, which can be installed using pip:pip install turtle
Once you have installed Python and turtle, you can download or clone the repository and run the snake_game.py file.

### How to Play

Use the WASD keys to control the snake's direction: up, down, left, or right.
The snake will continue moving in its current direction until a new direction is selected.
Eat the food pellets to grow longer and increase your score.
Avoid hitting the walls or colliding with your own body.

#### Features
The game keeps track of your score and high score, which are displayed at the top of the screen.
The game gets progressively harder as your score increases, by increasing the speed of the snake.
The game ends if the snake hits the wall or collides with its own body, and you must start over from the beginning.
